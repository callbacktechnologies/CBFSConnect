## Sample Projects
| Sample Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Cached FUSE Drive](./CBFS%20Connect%20Samples/Cached%20FUSE%20Drive) | Demonstrates using the FUSE component to create a simple in-memory virtual drive with directory support with CBCache working as an intermediary caching mechanism. |
| [Cached Folder Drive](./CBFS%20Connect%20Samples/Cached%20Folder%20Drive) | Shows how to use CBCache when implementing a virtual filesystem. Another locally accessible filesystem is used as a backend storage. |
